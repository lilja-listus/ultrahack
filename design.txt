 - Account Matching Logic

When a new travel notice arrives, it will need to be compared to the user's
existing schedule:

Do we ban users from submitting travel notices to their own location?

 () Let current user be "user" and user who sent travel notice be "friend"

 () Fetch all of user's travel notices with a start date greater than friend's
    end date and end date less than friend's start date. If this is a
    non-empty set, determine precise dates of overlap and non-overlap, and
    send notifications if user and friend will be in the same place at the
    same time. 

 () Ignore notice from friend if there is no overlap, and notice is not for
    user's home location. Otherwise, send notification to user. If user's
    location at that time will be their home location, or their planned
    location was added via a travel notice shared with friend, then send an
    email to friend as well. 

 () Submitted travel notices are sent off to each user who they are meant to be
    shared with, with no additional filtering. 




 - Database

 () Table of friends: userID X userID

 () Table of users: userID, username and/or name, home, ???

 () Table of travel plans: planID, userID, destination, start time
    () We don't need end times --- just add another row for the trip home.
       There will be end times in the actual notifications, just not in DB.

 () Visibility table: planID X userID (i.e. plan123 X kechpaja = kechpaja knows
    about plan123)



 - Future

 () Automatically send notification canceling travel notice when user adds a
    new notice contradicting their existing plans, or cancels a notice they
    posted? Probably don't need any special infrastructure for this; just send
    a notice for the new location?
