Vastoma

Many of us have friends, relatives, and possibly business partners all over 
the world, whom we see only infrequently when traveling. However, planning a
trip to see far-away friends is currently a rather imprecise science: in the
best-case scenario, you post about each trip on social media, your friends
comment on the post, and then you follow up with each friend individually. In
the worst-case scenario, you have to remember who you know in each city you
plan to visit, and message every person separately. 

We can simplify this process. Vastoma — meaning "meeting" in the Finno-Ugric
language Mokša — will let you publish your travel plans to any and all of your
friends and family members who live at (or are also planning to travel to)
your destination. At Ultrahack, we intend to build a functional prototype 
(simple web app + backend) of our solution.
