Vastoma

In the 21st Century, many of us have friends and family all over the world.
However, even when we know we'll be traveling to a place near where they live,
planning to actually meet up is a hassle: social media posts get buried by 
algorithms, emails go unsent, friends move and forget to let us know. 

We can do better. Vastoma — from the Mordviniv word for "meeting" — will
share your travel plans with your friends and relatives living at (or planning
to travel to) your destination, and put you in touch with anyone who wants to
meet up. 

We intend to build a functional prototype (simple web app + backend) of the
planned service, using AWS and Google's Progressive Web App framework.
