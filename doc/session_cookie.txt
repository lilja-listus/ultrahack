This isn't going to be the final auth system, but it will need to be good
enough for us to get through the hackathon. Update to something
industry-standard later if we ever actually go live. 


Session information is stored as an HTTP-only cookie, set by the login
endpoint. This cookie must contain both the user ID and some auth token that
will be verified on every endpoint call. 

How about two cookies:

userID: <user ID>
authToken: <auth token>

This means that user ID's can't contain colons, but that's no big deal. They
may contain @ signs if we ever set up federation, but for the most part they
will be alphanumeric, hex, or perhaps just numeric strings.
